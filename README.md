# Task 1 – Scan Local Network for Open Ports

## 🎯Objective
Discover open ports on devices in local network to understand network exposure.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap

## 🖥 Steps Followed
1. Found local IP range: 192.168.111.0/24
2. Ran TCP SYN scan:

nmap -sS 192.168.111.0/24

3. Saved result:

nmap -sS 192.168.111.0/24 -oN scan_result.txt

## 📌 Outcome
- Learned port scanning basics and exposure
- Understood how TCP SYN scan works

## 📎 Files
- scan_result.txt (Nmap output)
- Screenshot(s): terminal running scan (if added)

## ✏ Interview Questions Prepared
- What is an open port?
- How does Nmap perform TCP SYN scan?
- Risks of open ports, etc.
